 * Hi there, I'm Eli√°n and in this project it's where I complete the Advent of Code puzzles in Kotlin.
 *
 * The solutions I give in every puzzle I try to make them easy to read and understand rather than being the most efficient way to do it
 * since they're just simple puzzles.
 *
 * In case you found this repository I hope my solutions can be interesting or helpful for you.

 * one way could be to make use of reflection and source generation, but I would prefer
 * to avoid that kind of solution, also it's kind of difficult to deal with it with my actual knowledge.
