 * Hi there, I'm Eli√°n and in this project it's where I complete the Advent of Code puzzles in Kotlin.
 *
 * The solutions I give in every puzzle I try to make them easy to read and understand rather than being the most efficient way to do it
 * since they're just simple puzzles.
 *
 * In case you found this repository I hope my solutions can be interesting or helpful for you.
